### Implementation Recommendations

### Financial Impact Projections

- **Balanced Approach:** 90% occupancy within 12 months, moderate concession cost
- **Value Positioning:** 90% occupancy within 15 months, lower concession cost but longer absorption period

**Long-Term NOI Optimization**
- **Year 1:** Focus on occupancy, higher concession costs
- **Year 2:** Reduce concessions, implement moderate renewal increases
- **Year 3+:** Minimal concessions, standard renewal increases, focus on resident retention

This pricing and incentive framework provides SOL Modern with a strategic approach to maximize rental revenue while maintaining competitive positioning in the Roosevelt Row submarket.
